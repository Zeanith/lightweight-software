# Lightweight Software

A list of small, fast, efficient and just plain awesome software I have encountered.  

**Warning:** Currently this list is **mostly windows only**, but that may change in the future.

All entries in the list are sorted by **Installation Size** which is the observed size on-disk of the installation directory after a (ideally) non portable installation. 

**Attention:** Some of these programs look ~~old~~ vintage and ~~ugly~~ aesthetically challenged. The primary focus of this list is size and speed for their given domains.
